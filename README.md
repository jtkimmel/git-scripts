# git-scripts
Helpful scripts for adding and committing repo changes, especially for automation.

These scripts will add any and all modified files. A .gitignore file is strongly recommended so as to avoid adding files with passwords or other sensitive information, or particularly large files.

It's also recommended to keep the scripts in their own directory, away from other code. You will also need to make sure to update each script with appropriate file paths.
